# typingGame
A typing game built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS to help increase the typing speed of developers and other users.

## Introduction

Typing is a very underrated skill but this game is built with this purpose only - to help you increase your typing speed!
How we will do that? The game will present the player with a random quote (we're using Sherlock Holmes quotes) and time how long the player takes to type it out accurately.

## What did I learn? 

* Creating text input and button controls
* CSS and setting styles using classes
* JavaScript basics
   * Creating an array

   * Playing with event driven programming
